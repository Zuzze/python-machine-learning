Hold-out set reasoning
For which of the following reasons would you want to use a hold-out set for the very end?

Answer:
You want to be absolutely certain about your model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

The idea is to tune the model's hyperparameters on the training set, and then evaluate its performance on the hold-out set which it has never seen before.
